- 👋 Hi, I’m @Protofl4re
- I'm a second-year university student studying Materials Science & Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
- I'm originally from Thailand.
- I can speak Thai, English, Mandarin and Spanish. I pass through Japan a lot, so I'm trying to learn Japanese at the moment. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Materials (Obviously), but I do like video games (RPGs, MMORPGs and JRPGs), anime and reading books.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python as it is required by my university for most of my courses lmao
- 💞️ I’m looking for people to help me review my code, so any help is appreciated!
- 📫 How to reach me - Can probably just message me here, or my discord - protofl4re
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can explain to you all the lore of Warframe.
